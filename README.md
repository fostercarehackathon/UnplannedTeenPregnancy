# UnplannedTeenPregnancy
How might we prevent unplanned pregnancy among foster youth?

## Proposed Solution

One of the core issues identified by the subject matter experts was a lack of easy access to available resources and support groups. We built a prototype app to connect foster youth with the resources in their area and nationwide. This prototype uses some real data, but can also be extended with more information and features. We believe using curated, known-good data for services is important in this case since algorithms cannot be relied on to provide a safe environment.
